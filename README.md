# Compost-Dataset

This repository contains the dataset for the research titled:
**"Compost Maturity Prediction and Gas Emissions Monitoring: A Sensor-Based and Interpretable Machine Learning Approach"**.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes 452 samples collected during the composting process using a dedicated sensor system. It contains key environmental features and gas emission data, enabling predictive analysis for compost maturity and monitoring of gas emissions.

### Features:
- **Day:** Time since the start of the composting process.
- **Temperature:** Temperature readings (in Â°C).
- **MC (%):** Moisture content percentage.
- **pH:** Acidity or alkalinity of the compost.
- **C/N Ratio:** Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.
- **Ammonia (mg/kg):** Ammonia concentration in the compost.
- **Nitrate (mg/kg):** Nitrate concentration in the compost.
- **TN (%):** Total nitrogen content.
- **TOC (%):** Total organic carbon content.
- **EC (ms/cm):** Electrical conductivity.
- **OM (%):** Organic matter percentage.
- **T Value:** Transformation value.
- **GI (%):** Germination index percentage.
- **Score:** Compost maturity score.

### Data Collection:
The dataset was collected using a sensor system integrated with Arduino Mega 2560 R3 and ESP-32 microcontrollers. The system wirelessly transmitted data for remote monitoring. Ten datasets were merged after rigorous preprocessing to form this comprehensive dataset. Environmental features such as temperature, C/N ratio, ammonia concentration, pH levels, and nitrate content were analyzed for maturity prediction.

## Usage
Researchers can use this dataset for:
- Developing predictive models for compost maturity.
- Monitoring gas emissions during composting.
- Implementing interpretable machine learning frameworks for environmental data.

### Suggested Tools:
- Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LIME, SHAP.
